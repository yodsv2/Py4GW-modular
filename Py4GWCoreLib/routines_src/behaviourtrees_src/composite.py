"""
BT routines support file notes
==============================

This file is both:
- part of the BT routines support layer
- shared helper code used by other BT routine groups

Authoring and discovery conventions
-----------------------------------
- Keep existing class names as the system-level grouping surface.
- Use `PascalCase` for public/front-facing routine methods.
- Use `snake_case` for helper/internal methods.
- Use `_snake_case` for explicitly private helpers.
- Treat this file as support code rather than a primary discovery surface.

Routine docstring template
--------------------------
Each routine docstring should use:
- a free human-readable description first
- a structured `Meta:` block after it

Template:

    \"\"\"
    One or more human-readable paragraphs explaining what the routine builds.

    Meta:
      Expose: false
      Audience: advanced
      Display: Internal Sequence Helper
      Purpose: Support other BT routine builders.
      UserDescription: Internal support routine.
      Notes: Keep metadata single-line. Structural truth should stay in code.
    \"\"\"

Docstring parsing rules
-----------------------
- Only the `Meta:` section is intended for machine parsing.
- Keep metadata lines single-line and in `Key: Value` form.
- Unknown keys should be safe for tooling to ignore.
- Prefer adding presentation/help metadata in docstrings instead of duplicating
  structural metadata that already exists in code.
